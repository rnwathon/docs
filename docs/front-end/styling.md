Currently, I'm exploring Tailwindcss and CSS-in-JS, so it becomes my first choice when I create my own just-for-fun projects or experiment.

But in terms of developing medium to large projects especially in professional work, I tend to choose the way of styling based on the kind of application that I develop and wether its already has opinions or not (for legacy projects).

I rarely use only vanilla CSS in development nowadays except for very-very-very small projects.

These are my current preferences:

- [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/) (combine with [Headless UI](https://headlessui.dev/))
- CSS-in-JS (when using [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/))
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) (when using [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/))
- [LESS](https://lesscss.org/) (when using [Ant Design](https://ant.design/))
