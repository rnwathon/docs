# Introduction

Hi there 👋 this is my personal documentation site. It contains my practices in programming and web development and also several things that I commonly used like tech stacks, libraries, etc.

I don't always apply all of the practices in this documentation because in my professional work I often work in a team or get a legacy project that already has its own opinions and practices. I follow them to be consistent. But, for the project that I started or my personal project, I tend to apply these practices.

> ***⚠️ All of the content in this documentation is just my preference and it will be updated as my knowledge grows, so please take everything you read with a grain of salt 🤞***
